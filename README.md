## Introduction


Because this course falls in the "independent study" realm, the pace and topics it covers are determined by the student 
and instructor. My goals for this course are as follows: 

- To further understand the galactic processes that fuel the IGM
- To trace events to scale from ISM to the Large Scale Structure of the Universe
- To survey the current understanding of this topic at the most advanced level possible

This course will make use of a list of a variety of learning material. Specifically, many course sections and
assignments will taken from two books:

- [Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium by Ryden and Pogge](https://github.com/CambridgeUniversityPress/Interstellar-and-Intergalactic-Medium)
- [Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium by Bruce T. Draine](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Interstellar-Intergalactic-Medium-Draine-ebook/dp/B004MYFLCM)

Additionally, a collection of papers has been curated to support the third goal of this course:

- [New Analytic Solutions for Galaxy Evolution II: Wind Recycling, Galactic Fountains and Late-Type Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01643)
- [The Nature of Ionized Gas in the Milky Way Galactic Fountain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11014)
- [New Analytic Solutions for Galaxy Evolution: Gas, Stars, Metals and Dust in local Early-Type Galaxies and in their high-z Starforming Progenitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07458)
- [On Dark Matter As A Geometric Effect in the Galactic Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09466)
- [The Magellanic Stream at 20 kpc: A New Orbital History for the Magellanic Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11355)
- [The Origin of the Magellanic Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9401008)

As the course progresses, the Table of Contents below will be updated to reflect each learning section and its location 
within this repository.
