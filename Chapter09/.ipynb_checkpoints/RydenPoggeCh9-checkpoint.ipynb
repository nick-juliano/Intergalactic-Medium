    "# Diffuse Intergalactic Medium\n",
    "___\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the hydrogen et. al. has not accumulated in galaxies and remains in intergalactic space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature fluxtuations provide insight on the density of baryonic matter in the universe. <i>Planck</i> puts this value at $\\bar{\\rho}_{bary,0} = (4.21 \\pm 0.03) \\times 10^{-31} g\\ cm^{-3}$, which places the mean number density of baryons at $\\bar{n}_{bary,0} = 2.52 \\times 10^{-7} cm^{-3}$\n",

    "## 9.1 Gunn-Peterson Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because of universal expansion, certain parameters change with time/distance: \n",
    "    - Mean baryon density & number density decreases with time. $\\bar{n}_{bary}(t)=\\bar{n}_{bary,0}(1+z)^{3}$\n",
    "    - Energy of emitted photons $hv(t)=hv_{0}(1+z)$\n",
    "- Optical depth at redshift $\\tau_{v}=c\\sigma_\\alpha \\frac{n_{l}(z)}{H(z)}$\n",
    "- At redshifts $z<<1$, $\\tau_{v}\\sim 1.5\\times 10^4(\\frac{n_{l,0}(z)}{\\bar{n}_{bary,0}})$\n",
    "- For a quasar at redshift $z$, strong Lyman $\\alpha$ absorption in the observed wavelength range $\\lambda_{0} 1216 \\rightarrow 1216(1+z)  \\unicode[serif]{xC5}$ is called the <b>Gunn-Peterson effect</b>\n",
    "- Consequence of this effect, intergalactic gas either:\n",
    "    - ⬜️ has a density much lower than mean baryon density of the universe\n",
    "    - ✅ is very highly ionized \n",

    "## 9.2 Recombination\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hydrogen stopped beion ionized at recombination, $z \\sim 1400$\n",
    "- Hydrogen became ionized again at reionization, $z \\sim 7$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature of CMB decreases with expansion. $kT_0 = (2.3486 \\pm 0.0005 \\times 10^{-4}eV$\n",
    "- Temperature previously was $T=T_{0}(1+z)$\n",
    "- When the temperature dropped below $kT \\sim 66 keV$, deuterium nuclei could form without photodissociation. Enter Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. \n",
    "- At $kT=0.330eV$ (i.e., $z\\sim1400$ and $t \\sim 0.23 Myr$, recombination of hydrogen.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 9.3 Reionization\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Dark Ages\" is brought by recombination of hydrogen: era between recombination and formation of first stars ($t\\sim100Myr$).\n",
    "- Not completely dark, CMB still exists. \n",
    "- <b>Reionization</b> accomplished by UV photons from massive stars and AGN.\n",
    "- Patchy, gradual process around individual star-forming galaxies, expanding outward. So there is no clear instant of reionization and it is understood better as an epoch of transition.\n",
    "- What the CMB can tell us about reionization:\n",
    "    - low-redshift reionized gas of IGM informs the population of free elections between us and CMB.\n",
    "    - free electrons scatter photons of CMB via Thomson scattering. \n",
    "    - If optical depth from Thomson scattering was high, then CMB temperature fluxuations would disipate and make original direction of motion untracable. \n",
    "    - Thus, $\\tau _ {e} <<1$\n",
    "    - The small amount of scatterings have imposed a slight feathering of the temperature gradient in the CMB. \n",
    "    - <i> note to self: this topic was covered in a question in last year's qualifying exam </i>\n",

    "\n",
    "This section interprets observed regions with varying column densities, defined in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Lyman alpha forest</b> - a portion of short-wavelength absorption lines observed along the line of sight to quasars (see figure 9.1)\n",
    "    - Not representative of gravitationally collapsed systems. \n",
    "- <b>Lyman limit systems</b> - slightly more dense than a Lyman alpha forest, these systems are thick enough that radiation doesn't reach their interior and neutral hydrogen still remains (self shielding). \n",
    "- <b>Damped Lyman alpha systems</b> - absorbing systems with a large neutral hydrogen column density. \n",
    "    - These column densities are comparable to large galaxies.\n",
    "    - Thought of as gravitationaly bound protogalaxies which are not effective at converting gas into stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation </b> - the below equation (9.65) that describes the equivalent of Gunn-Peterson absorption for a non-uniform photoionized medium. \n",
